# Techniques  

Our lab investigates the molecular and neural coding principles underlying motivated behaviors, bridging the gaps between molecular mechanisms, circuit dynamics, and behavior. We aim to decipher how the brain orchestrates competing and synergistic motivationsâ€”an essential question in neuroscience that remains unresolved despite decades of progress.  

## Imaging and Circuit-Dissection Techniques  

### CaRMA Imaging

    CaRMA (Calcium imaging with RNA Multiplexed Analysis) integrates calcium imaging with high-resolution spatial transcriptomics to simultaneously monitor neural activity and gene expression within defined circuits.  This approach enables us to **link functional activity to molecular identity**, providing insights into how neuromodulatory genes shape motivated behaviors.

         style="width: 100px; float: right; margin-right: 15px; shape-outside: margin-box; border-radius: 10px;">
    Two-photon fluorescence microscopy allows us to visualize neural activity in deep brain structures **with high spatial and temporal resolution**. This technique is crucial for understanding real-time neuronal responses in behaving animals, particularly in regions involved in **motivation, reward, and aggression circuits**.

         style="width: 100px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; shape-outside: margin-box; border-radius: 10px;">
    Optogenetics enables precise **manipulation of neural circuits using light-sensitive ion channels**. By selectively activating or inhibiting neuronal populations, we investigate **causal relationships between specific circuits and behaviors**, including **hedonic eating, social observation, and aggression control**.

    MERFISH (Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) is an advanced spatial transcriptomics method that allows **single-cell resolution mapping of gene expression** across the brain. By combining MERFISH with behavioral analyses, we can identify molecular signatures associated with **dopamine modulation, obesity-related circuits, and social motivation pathways**.

## Future Directions  
By integrating **high-resolution imaging, optogenetic manipulations, and molecular profiling**, our lab aims to **decode the principles of neuromodulation** that govern motivation-related behaviors. These techniques will pave the way for **targeted interventions in neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders**.
