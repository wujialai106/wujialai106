# Research  

Our lab investigates the molecular and neural coding principles underlying motivated behaviors, bridging the gaps between molecular mechanisms, circuit dynamics, and behavior. We aim to decipher how the brain orchestrates competing and synergistic motivations—an essential question in neuroscience that remains unresolved despite decades of progress.  

### Decoding Aggression Circuits

During my PhD at Zhejiang University with Dr. Shumin Duan, I employed interdisciplinary approaches—including in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, machine-learning-assisted behavioral analysis, and molecular profiling—to study aggression circuits. My work uncovered:  
- A **substantia innominata–midbrain circuit** governing graded aggressive states in mice (**Neuron 2021**).  
- A **male-biased hypothalamic-amygdala pathway** essential for aggression initiation (**Neuron 2024**).  
- A **neuromodulatory ion channel** driving sex differences in aggressive behavior (**BioRxiv 2024**).  

These discoveries provided foundational insights into how genetic and circuit-level mechanisms regulate aggression, earning recognition as one of **Zhejiang University’s Top 10 Discoveries (2021)** and the **Provincial Outstanding Thesis Prize**.  

### Motivated Eating and Social Behaviors

As a **Sanford Postdoctoral Fellow** in Dr. Scott Sternson’s lab at UC San Diego/HHMI, I expanded my research into **hedonic eating and social motivation**:  
- I identified a **brainstem dopamine pathway (peri-locus coeruleus → VTADA)** that dynamically encodes food palatability, **regulating hedonic feeding** (**Science, in press**).  
- This mechanism also explains the **efficacy of GLP-1R agonists**, a class of **anti-obesity drugs**.  
- I developed a **novel behavioral paradigm** for **food-reinforced social observation**, uncovering dopamine as a key neuromodulator of social motivation.  

### Innovative Tools for Neural Circuit Dissection  
To unravel the molecular underpinnings of motivation, I pioneered **EASEQ-FISH (Expansion-Assisted Sequential Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization)**, an advanced **3D spatial transcriptomics** platform that integrates with neuronal activity imaging (**CARMA**). This approach enables:  
- High-throughput **molecular profiling (~100 genes)** in functionally defined circuits.  
- Identification of **molecularly and projection-defined cell types** linked to motivated states.  
- A translational framework for studying motivation-related disorders, including **autism, depression, and obesity**.  

### Future Directions  
As an independent investigator, I will build on these discoveries to explore **universal principles of neuromodulation**, integrating **spatial transcriptomics, circuit-specific interventions, and computational ethology**. Our long-term goal is to **decode how the brain orchestrates competing motivational drives** and develop strategies for diagnosing and treating **motivation-related disorders**, from **neuropsychiatric diseases to metabolic dysfunctions**.

# Contributions to Science
### A 'Rage' Center Identified in the Mouse Brain
In the realm of aggressive behaviors, previous research focused on specific circuits governing distinct forms of aggression. However, the broader question of how the brain triggers various aggressive behaviors during a 'rage' state remained unanswered. One of My PhD work, published in Neuron in 2021, challenged existing models by uncovering a central locus for a general aggressive state in the mouse brain. This discovery reshaped our understanding, as it revealed that the pSI neurons in the amygdala play a general role. These molecularly defined neurons responded dynamically to aggression-provoking cues, predicting aggressive states in mice. Optogenetic activation of pSI neurons projecting to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) not only heightened aggressive arousal but also robustly promoted multiple types of aggressive behavior, including infanticide, predation, and male/female aggression. Unlike specific circuits for isolated attacks, pSI acts as a central "switchboard," integrating threshold information from various aggression circuits to orchestrate attacks under different conditions.

### Deciphering Neural Mechanisms of Sexually Dimorphic Aggression
Typically, males display higher levels of aggression than females in mammals, but the neural basis for this distinction has long eluded researchers. My research proposes and substantiates a circuit model that elucidates male-biased aggression. A key sexually dimorphic aggression-eliciting (DAE) region is the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral area (VMHvl). I found that this region intricately connects with shared monomorphic aggression-eliciting (MAE) neurons in the posterior substantia innominata (pSI) through both excitatory and inhibitory pathways in mice. In males, these excitatory dimorphic → monomorphic connections are fortified to promote aggression, while females exhibit robust inhibitory connections that suppress aggressive behavior. Additionally, I pinpointed the HCN1 channel in the monomorphic aggression-eliciting (MAE) pSI neurons as a pivotal molecule governing sex-specific aggression under natural conditions. Manipulating HCN1 channel expression in pSI neurons led to the feminization and masculinization of mouse aggression in females and males, respectively. These discoveries unveil a circuit logic characterized by sexually distinct excitation-inhibition balances, along with key molecular players within the circuit, providing insights into the male-biased manifestation of aggression in mice.

### Dissecting Mechanisms of Hedonic Eating
Hedonic eating, driven by palatability rather than physiological need, plays a critical role in obesity, but its neural control remains poorly understood. I have identified a novel neural circuit from the peri-locus coeruleus (periLC) to VTA dopamine (VTADA) neurons that regulate palatable food intake. Using neuronal activity-calibrated optogenetics, I demonstrated that VTADA neurons encode palatability and bidirectionally control hedonic eating. Remarkably, GLP-1R agonist semaglutide, an anti-obesity drug, suppressed VTADA neuron activity during consumption, reducing food intake. However, repeated semaglutide treatment allowed recovery of both food appetite and VTADA neuron activity, which could be reversed by targeted inhibition of VTADA neurons. These findings offer new insights into the neural mechanisms driving hedonic eating and reveal how they interact with anti-obesity treatments like semaglutide. This manuscript is in press (Science), and I have presented these initial findings at multiple scientific meetings.

### Advanced Perturbation Techniques to Study Motivated Behaviors 
My research journey has seen the adaptation of cutting-edge tools in neuroscience, including cell-type-specific optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology recordings, machine-learning-based behavioral and neuronal ensemble investigations, all focused on unraveling the complexities of various motivated behaviors such as social observation, feeding, aggression, sleep, and pain responses. This integration of advanced perturbation techniques with the exploration of diverse behaviors has led to a compelling convergence, shedding light on the intricate relationship between these methods and fundamental survival necessities. Furthermore, recognizing the need for real-time, unbiased molecular insights into neuronal activities in the field, I have ventured into the development and advancement of innovative approaches like EASEQ-FISH and CaRMA imaging. These pioneering efforts aim to address profound questions regarding the control of motivated behaviors in mice.
