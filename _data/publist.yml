- title: "Hedonic eating is controlled by dopamine neurons that oppose GLP-1R satiety"
  image: Pub_Sci.png
  description: Identifies a brainstem dopamine pathway (peri-locus coeruleus → VTADA) encoding food palatability.
    - Demonstrates that dopamine promotes hedonic eating despite satiety signals from GLP-1 receptors.
    - Provides mechanistic insight into how GLP-1R agonists suppress food cravings and promote weight loss.
    - Establishes a neural framework linking metabolic and reward-driven feeding behaviors.
