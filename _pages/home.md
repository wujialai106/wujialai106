I am Zhenggang Zhu, a **Sanford Postdoctoral Fellow** at the **Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) / UC San Diego**, where I investigate the molecular and neural coding principles underlying motivation and behavior. My research integrates **molecular genetics, circuit neuroscience, and behavioral analysis** to uncover the neural mechanisms that drive **hedonic eating, aggression, and social motivation**.  

During my PhD at **Zhejiang University**, I explored how **neuromodulatory circuits regulate aggression**. My work revealed:  
- A substantia innominata–midbrain circuit controlling graded aggression (**Neuron, 2021**).  
- A male-biased hypothalamic-amygdala pathway driving aggressive initiation (**Neuron, 2024**).  
- An ion channel mechanism underlying sex differences in aggression (**BioRxiv, 2024**).  

As a postdoc, I expanded my research to **motivated behaviors**, focusing on how **dopaminergic circuits regulate feeding and social interactions**. My recent discoveries include:  
- A brainstem dopamine pathway (peri-locus coeruleus → VTA DA) that encodes food palatability, explaining the efficacy of **GLP-1R agonist anti-obesity drugs** (**Science, in press**).  
- A novel behavioral paradigm for food-reinforced social observation, revealing that dopamine is a core neuromodulator of social motivation.  
- The development of EASEQ-FISH (Expansion-Assisted Sequential Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), a 3D spatial transcriptomics platform that integrates molecular and functional imaging, enabling the mapping of motivation-related neural circuits.  


Despite the challenges of parenting and coordinating a cross-country lab relocation, I have published multiple first-author papers in **Science, Neuron, and Molecular Psychiatry**, with **two additional manuscripts in preparation**. My work has been recognized with a Sanford Postdoctoral Fellowship, a Sanford Seed Grant, and NIH K99/R00 eligibility, highlighting my resilience and dedication.  

As an independent investigator, I will establish a cutting-edge research program aimed at uncovering **universal principles of neuromodulation** and developing **translational strategies for motivation-related disorders**, including autism, depression, and obesity. My lab will integrate spatial transcriptomics, computational ethology, and circuit-specific interventions to push the frontiers of behavioral neuroscience.  

I am grateful for funding from UC San Diego, HHMI, and the Sanford Institute, as well as support from NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Awards and an [ERC starting and consolidator grants](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants).



<!-- **News: Our group will move to the University of UC San Diego!** Over the next two years, we will establish a new research lab focused on neuroscience and dopamine signaling at XXU. As part of this transition, we will gradually relocate our experimental systems and expand our research capabilities.

We are actively seeking PhD students, postdocs, and research staff with expertise in neuroscience, dopamine systems, behavioral analysis, calcium imaging, optogenetics, and computational modeling. Additionally, we welcome applications for engineering/technical roles and an administrative assistant to support our expanding lab.

If you are interested in joining us, please reach out! More details to follow.
# Welcome to the Zhenggang Lab   -->

<!-- We are an interdisciplinary research group currently based at UC San Diego, with plans to expand our work into new frontiers of neuroscience and motivated behavior research. Our goal is to decode the molecular and circuit mechanisms that govern motivated behaviors, such as hedonic eating, social observation, and aggression. By integrating spatial transcriptomics, circuit-specific interventions, and computational ethology, we aim to uncover fundamental principles of neuromodulation and their implications for obesity, addiction, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Our research has identified a brainstem dopamine pathway (peri-locus coeruleus → VTADA) that regulates food palatability and hedonic feeding, offering new insights into the neural basis of obesity and the mechanisms underlying GLP-1R agonist therapies (Science, in press). Additionally, our work on aggression circuits has revealed how the substantia innominata-midbrain circuit controls a general aggressive response, providing a framework for understanding how neuromodulatory genes shape sex-specific aggressive behaviors (Neuron, 2021; 2024). To further explore these complex circuits, we developed EASEQ-FISH, a 3D spatial transcriptomics platform that enables high-throughput molecular mapping of neural dynamics.

We are actively expanding our research efforts and welcome collaborations with scientists in molecular neuroscience, circuit biology, and computational modeling. Our move to a new research institute will facilitate interactions with world-class groups in systems neuroscience, behavioral science, and neural computation. We look forward to building next-generation neurotechnology that will revolutionize our understanding of motivated behaviors and their dysfunctions in conditions such as depression, autism, and eating disorders. -->
